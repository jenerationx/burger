In this project, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. I followed the MVC design pattern, using Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.  Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour It!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.  The app stores every burger in a MySQL database, whether devoured or not.
